The Australian Signals Directorate produces the Information Security Manual (ISM) [here](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/ism). The ISM is a cybersecurity framework that organisations can implement alongside their risk management frameworks to protect their information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) systems, applications, and data from cyber threats.

However, the controls are not presented in a manner that easily supports traceability within the software lifecycle. The purpose of this site is to address this issue.
