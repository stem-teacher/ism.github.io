<p>When malicious code is detected, the following steps are taken to handle the infection:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>the infected systems are isolated</li>
                     <li>all previously connected media used in the period leading up to the infection are scanned for signs of infection and isolated if necessary</li>
                     <li>antivirus software is used to remove the infection from infected systems and media</li>
                     <li>if the infection cannot be reliably removed, systems are restored from a known good backup or rebuilt.</li>
                  </ul>
